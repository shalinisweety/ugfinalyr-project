                    <p>Situated at the height of 17,380 feet, Pin Parvati Pass trek is a true stunner, starting from Phulga village of Kullu, Kasol and ending at Mud village of Spiti.

Witness the tree line disappearing into a grassland of wildflowers and disheveled shrubs, the uncanny Parvati valley through which the Parvati river chisels its curvy path and the equally contrasting deserted mountains bearing the spell of Spiti’s barrenness. And that's not all!! Traversing 78 KM on foot in 10 days, you don't only experience the transition of the landscape from green paradise to barren mountains, but also a transition between two cultures, from Hinduism to Buddhism, a remarkable rarity. This trek is one of the most challenging treks in Himachal also the most beautiful. Trekking duration is 12 days.</p>
